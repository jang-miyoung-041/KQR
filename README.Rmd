# Kernel Quatile Regression

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BsplineReg is to fit a regression spline estimator based on a set of data $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BsplineReg from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("kybak90/BsplineReg")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(KQReg)
set.seed(923)  
n = 30
x_values = sort(runif(n, 0, 1))
y_values = sin(2 * pi * x_values) + cos(4 * pi * x_values) + rnorm(n, sd = 0.2)
```
